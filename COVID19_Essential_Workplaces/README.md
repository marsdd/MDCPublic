# Ontario Essential Workplaces

This crosswalk maps the Ontario’s Essential Workplaces to 4-digit NAICS industry groups.

The [Essential Workplaces list](https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-essential-workplaces) identifies workplaces whose physical locations are legally allowed to remain open as others are required to close in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through the province of Ontario. The list was first published by the Government of Ontario on March 24, 2020, and later updated on April 3. This crosswalk is based on the April 3 updated version.

The crosswalk maps Essential Workplaces to 4-digit industry groups based on the [2017 Version 3.0 of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1181553) used by Statistics Canada. A given Essential Workplace may be mapped to multiple industry groups.

The ‘entirely_essential’ column indicates whether all industries under a 4-digit industry group are considered essential workplaces (which is the case when entirely_essential = 1), or whether only some  industries under the industry group are considered essential workplaces (which is the case when entirely_essential = 0).

MaRS Data Catalyst is providing this crosswalk free of charge as a resource for people looking to understand how COVID-19 is impacting Ontarians. Please acknowledge ‘MaRS Data Catalyst’ when using it.
